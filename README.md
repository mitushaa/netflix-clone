## Compound Components

Is a design pattern in which components are collated together to create a complete experience. <br>
No need to pass a lot of props<br>
Components can be rearranged in any order<br>
No need for componnets to be jammed together and can be writen independently

##  Using Styled-compents along with this pattern
They are just templete literals<br>
We can define the semantic element we want
